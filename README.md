# gestureController
This is a Python program that can recognise the vowels - a, e, i, o, and u - in sign language. It maps out hand landmarks on both hands, such as figertips or your wrist, and calculates the distance between any two given landmarks. If they match the landmark distance required for a vowel, it will print it out.

# How to Install :
1. Create a folder on your computer to store the files.
2. Clone the repository.
3. cd gestureController
4. Create a virtual envirnment : python -m venv venv
5. cd venv/Scripts
6. activate
7. cd ..\\..
8. pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Run : 
Run the file called gesture_controller.py. 
It will take a second to laod, but there is logging to let you know where the program is at. 
To make it easier to detect vowels, have you hands facing each other inwards, with your fingertips facing each other.

# Sign Language Controls
A - Tip of index finger to tip of thumb on other hand.
E - Tip of index finger to top of index finer on ther hand.
I - Tip of index finger to tip of middle finger on other hand.
O - Tip of index finger to tp of ring finger on other hand.
U - Tip of index finger to tip of pinky on other hand.

The hand on the right of the screen is the one you use with your index finger to touch the other ingers on the hand on the left on the screen.
